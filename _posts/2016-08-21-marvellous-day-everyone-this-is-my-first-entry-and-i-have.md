Marvellous day everyone! 

This is my first entry, and I have a confession to make. I want to quit. 

Why? I have great job and make a good living. Secure, comfortable, somewhat challenging and excellent conditions. I'm not bored per se yet I feel the weight of the 9 to 5\. 

I want to travel, a lot. I want to be a digital nomad for a while. Maybe build a lifestyle business. I even dream of improving my income significantly, even if its not my objective. 

So what do I do? I have, at my current spending rate, roughly 2 years worth of savings. Saving 60% of my take home pay helps. 

Should I start a side gig that is location independent? I haven't coded since my interships. Over 6 years ago. Getting back in coding shape is going to take some serious work.

Should I simply quit, or ask for a 2 years unpaid leave? I could figure it out as I go. Buy myself a laptop, build this website and work getting revenues. I'm smart enough, that computer engineering degree and that MBA would come in handy I presume. Scary stuff though,
